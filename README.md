#ag84ark changes

I was finally able to make it work with plugin version 1.0.11 and Xcode 12.5

Podfile

```
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '10.0'
    end
  end
end

pod 'Stripe', :git => 'https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios.git', :tag => 'v19.4.1'
```

In the plugin v1.0.11 -> ios/TPSStripeManager.h change:

```
- #import <Stripe/Stripe.h>
+ @import Stripe;
```

Hope that this helps someone, it took me 2 days to get here :) ( No experience in Swift or Object C )
